# Scheduler - How to create a custom editing form

This example demonstrates how to create a custom editing form for appointments.

The main idea is to use a [Popup](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/) to display appointment data and to update appointments by calling methods from the [Scheduler API](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Appointments/Update_Appointments/#API).

In our particular case, we use a custom editing form to select a seat for a chosen movie.
